# Advent of Code 2025

## Day 1 (Clojure)

Trying very hard not to hate Clojure, but it's really hard. I just can't get onboard with the REPL paradigm. WDYM live coding? Just use types so you don't have to typecheck by hand in runtime like some kind of animal. Duh.

## Day 2 (Haskell)

While I tried to cast Advent of Code as so many do - to experience a new language - I really wanted to try out Haskell as it sounded as a good fit, even though I have already written a few things in it. Must say, comparing it to Clojure, it's rather arcane and unweildy. I think it's fair to say Scheme is to Clojure what Haskell is to Rust - an impractical arcane step-brother language that works as a didactic device.
